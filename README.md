This is a test source code for Airport.

Create a tab based iOS application in XCode, with 3 tabs.In tab 1, use location manager to detect & show the current location (reverse geo-coded to address) of the user.In tab 2, show the distance travelled, by the user, from the time the app was opened (assuming the user is moving as this can be simulated in the iOS Simulator) and show a notification when the user has travelled 50 mtrs.Please note that the notification should be visible even when Tab 2 is NOT the active tab.In tab 3, maintain a list of all sessions in which the user travelled more than 50 mtrs (display day, date & time once the user reached 50 mtrs mark). This list should be persistent and should be pre-populated, even between launches.ie. if user has travelled 50 mtrs once and closed the app, next time when he/she opens it, they should see that record in tab 3- Feel free to use any third party libraries (CocoaPods preferred).- Include at least basic unit tests in the code. Better unit tests can help you earn brownie points!Please check in the code in a Github repository and share the link with us.
